# Self-Attention vs Masked Self-Attention

- Explains the requirement for vector representation of words
  - To represent the different contexts the words can be used

## Word Embeddings

- The number of activation functions determines how many numbers we will use to represent each word.

- Weights are the word embedding values
  - Initialized randomly but trained to update these values
  ![Weights: Embedding values](../images/4_1.png)

  - Idea of training is to create similar embedding for **great** and **awesome** as both words appear in similar context in the training data.
  - The below figure shows the initial random value.

- Predicting next word
  - We want each word in the training data to predict the next word.
  - Prediction with initialized random values might predict incorrect next word for a word.
    - Here **pizza** predicts next word as **great** instead of **is**

  - Post-training next prediction improves
    - Here **pizza** predicts next word as **is**

  - Post-training **great** and **awesome** cluster together

- Adding more context
  - Instead of using only one word use more previous words to predict next word
  - This is required as training gets bigger and sentence length increases.

  - **1**: Assigned to the word used for context
  - Word ordering is not considered

## Context Aware Embeddings

- To overcome non-consideration of word order, Transformers use Positional Encoding.

- Context aware embeddings can cluster
  - Similar sentences
    ![Clustering similar sentences](../images/4_8.png)
  - Similar documents

## Encoder-Only Transformer

- Encoder-Only Transformer uses only **Self-Attention**

## Decoder-Only Transformer

- Self-Attention vs Masked Self-Attention
![Self-Attention vs Masked Self-Attention](../images/4_12.png)
  - Self-Attention: Considers both before and after words
  - Masked Self-Attention: Ignored words after the word of interest

## Encoder-Only vs Decoder-Only Transformer

- Encoder-Only transformer: Creates Context Aware Embeddings
  - Context Aware Embeddings are great inputs for creating classification neural network
    - Sentiment Analyis using Softmax
      ![Sentiment Analyis](../images/4_15.png)
    - Classification using Logistic Regression
      ![Classification using Logistic Regression](../images/4_16.png)
- Decoder-Only transformer: Creates Generative Inputs (?? Or should we call it Outputs)
![Encoder-Only vs Decoder-Only Transformer](../images/4_13.png)
  - Generative inputs can be plugged into a simple Neural Network to generate new tokens
    ![Generate new tokens](../images/4_14.png)
  - Also called **Generative Model**
  - These models are good at text generation because they are specifically trained to generate text that comes after a prompt.
